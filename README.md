#   image processing
#   Image filters a-la instagram or whatever I come up with
#   Also I have 0 experience with image filters, so maybe it won't
#   be that creative or interesting, but its new to me.

# Filter ideas:
#   Pixelating; take average color over area and make a 'low res' image
#   Bubbling: Pixelating, but rounded
#   Random Pix/Bub: Randomize size and position of bubbles

# Learning goals:
#   Matrices
#   Color models
#   Brightness/Contrast
#   Convolution
#   OpenCV UI

# Tutorial appears to use Anaconda, maybe RIP, but should probably learn that too.
